# Tomato
Tomato is rust based pomodoro timer that lives in your terminal.

Right now you can edit the default work and break time to your liking. The default is 25/5. You can start the timer and you have a visual indication of how much time has passed. You can see how many seconds have passed (I want to change this to a minute and second display at some point). You can see how many minutes you have worked this session. It also plays a sound when the work and break timers are done.

## Future imporvements
- Add persistent storage for how many minutes you have worked, so its not session limited. Display this in an appropriate format.
- Change the display from seconds to minutes and seconds
- Better terminal UI
