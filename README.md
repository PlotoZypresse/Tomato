Tomato is rust based pomodoro timer that lives in your terminal.

Right now you can edit the default work and break time to your liking. The default is 25/5. You can start the timer and you have a visual indication of how much time has passed. You can see how many minutes and seconds are left in the current session. You can see how many minutes you have worked this session. It also plays a sound when the work and break timers are done.

## Future imporvements
- Better terminal UI
